Description of part 1:
Our project is a Chinese fine arts auction information search engine that can be used to search for any 
specific type of Chinese fine art work, which has been shown on auction houses such as Sotheby's or 
Christies, by key words of an auction good's features. When users try to search for art works either in 
abstract by a single key word or with full description, all matched results should pop out, showing 
information containing name, lot number at a specific auction, its starndard price in US dollar, 
and furthermore, a URL links to the auction good for more details. 
An auction good is unique based on its URL. An auction good belongs to a certain class such as 
calligraphy, painting, ceramic, etc, with other characteristics like color, decoration pattern and mark. 
Also, it can be traced back to a unique time when it was made. An auction house is unique based on its 
name. 

This is an auction evaluation web project that allows you to search through our online database to find 
the auction good you intend to search.
After connecting to the index page, you will be asked to either log in with an account you already created 
or register for another account. You will automatically sign in after register for a new account.
After sign in, you can try to search either by auctions or goods.
In searching by auctions, by selecting a specific dealing year, month, auction house and location (or just 
do vague search by leaving some of them blank), we will end up to get a list of auction goods that fulfill 
these requirements with their hammer price.
In searching by goods, by selecting a class, time the good is produced and the color one belongs to, we will
 get a list of the name of auction goods with url's that connect to the auction goods' original webpage.
We can also scroll down on the homepage and click any of the six pictures to go to a list of goods with 
the specific class.
Also, check out our mobile version and you will find it works well.
